# Binding Classes in React

Pressing the button toggles the `lightOn` state. Add code such that:

* When the `lightOn` state is `true`, the button should have the classes `switch` and `off`, when the state is `false` the button should have the classes `switch` and `on`
* When the `lightOn` state is `true`, the light should have the classes `light` and `on`, when the state is `false` the button should have the classes `light` and `off`
